### **3. Fetch the Latest Updates**

Before starting any work, always update your local repository:

### **4. Switch to Your Assigned Branch**

Each classmate should work on their **own branch**. Replace `your-branch-name` with your assigned name:

```

If the branch doesnâ€™t exist locally yet, create it:

Push your updates to your branch:

```sh
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### **7. Delete Your Branch (If No Longer Needed)**

Once you have completed your work and no longer need your branch:

```sh
git branch -d your-branch-name
```

To remove it from GitHub as well:

```sh
git push origin --delete your-branch-name
```

## **Poetry & Virtual Environment Setup (Fedora)**

To work with dependencies and the virtual environment, follow these steps:

### **1. Install Poetry**

If Poetry is not installed, run:

Then, apply the changes:

```sh
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.bash_profile

### **3. Set Up the Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies**

```

If dependencies are missing or out of sync, run:

```sh
